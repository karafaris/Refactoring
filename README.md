# Refactoring HTML & CSS 
This page is the landing page for a website  designer organization so that anyone with disabilities can view the webpage.

## Description
My motivation was to understand the concepts of accessibility standards, and to be able to structure semantic HTML elements and CSS classes.
I built this code so my website meets accessibility standards and the problem it solves is my site is now optimized for search engines. I learned about semantic HTML elements, the difference between elements and classes, and how to find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning.
